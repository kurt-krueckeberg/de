## Sounds of German in the IPA

### Vowels

The German long vowels are written in the IPA as:

- `/a/`
- `/e/`
- `/i/`
- `/o:/`
- `/u/`

:::{note}
The slashes are not part of its IPA pronouncation.  They are used to illustrate it is a single letter (not a word).
:::

In the IPA, a word like, say, [mal](https://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/mal), is written

```
ˈma:l
```

The apostrophe `ˈ` indicates that the first syllable is stressed.  The `:` after the `a` indicates it is a long vowel. PONS dictionary gives
the IPA spelling of words. In PONS, the word [malen](https://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/malen), which also has a long "a", is written:

```
ma·len [ˈma:lən]
```

The upside down backward "e" is the schwa symbol. It stands for an unstressed or weak vowel sound like the "e" in chicken that gets swallowed
up when we pronounce the word "chick'in" or "chickn'n". In English and some other languages, it usually represents the mid central vowel sound

###  S sounds

`\z\` is the voiced s sound in words like: bee,fly,wasp. The "zzz..." sound; as in, for example, the word rasen:

```
ra·sen [ˈra:zn̩]
```

- rasen (to race,to drive too fast)
- der Rasen (meadow)

`\s\` is the unvoiced s sound. `ß` has the `\s\` sound.

Rede (speech) in IPA would be `'re:də`
