## German Dark Vowels: a, o and u

The vowels a, o and u are "dark" vowels. They are pronounced deeper in the throat. When they precede "ch", the "ch" has
the guttaral sound like in "Ach!".

## German ch Sound

There are two basic **ch** sounds in German: the ich-ch heard in **ich** and the **ch** heard in **Ach!**. The more "Ach" *ch* sound is used
when the "ch" follows the vowels `a`, `o` or `u`, like in:

- auch
- Buch
- besucht
- acht
- achtzig
- hoch
- Hochzeit
- Loch

## Schwa

In the IPA, &#x258; is the schwa symbol. It stands for an unstressed or weak vowel sound like the weakened "e" sound in chicken, where the "e" gets
swallowed, so what you hear is "chick'n" or "chick'in".

## s sounds

`\z\` is the voiced s sound in words like: bee,fly,wasp. The "zzz..." sound; as in, for example, the word rasen:

```
ra·sen [ˈra:zn̩]
```

- rasen (to race,to drive too fast)
- der Rasen (meadow)

`\s\` is the unvoiced s sound. `ß` has the `\s\` sound.

Rede (speech) spelled in IPA would be `'re:də`
