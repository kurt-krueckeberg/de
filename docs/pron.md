  that alone is not very meaningful.

### Vowels

In the [IPA](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/), a word like, say, [mal](https://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/mal), is written

```
ˈma:l
```

The `ˈ` above indicates the beginning of the word is stressed.  The `:` after `a` indicates `a` is long. [PONS] dictionary gives
the IPA spelling of words; for example, the word [malen](https://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/malen), which also has a long "a", is written:

```
ma·len [ˈma:lən]
```

The upside down backward "e" is the schwa symbol. It stands for an unstressed or weak vowel sound like the "e" in chicken that gets swallowed
up when we pronounce the word "chick'in" or "chickn'n". In English and some other languages, it usually represents the mid central vowel sound.
In German the schwa only occurs with the letter `e`. The best examples of this are the inflected endings of verb stems: reden, redest, lesen, 
machen, 


###  s sounds

`\z\` is the voiced s sound in words like: bee,fly,wasp. The "zzz..." sound; as in, for example, the word rasen:

```
ra·sen [ˈra:zn̩]
```

- rasen (to race,to drive too fast)
- der Rasen (meadow)

`\s\` is the unvoiced s sound. `ß` has the `\s\` sound.

Rede (speech) spelled in IPA would be `'re:də`

## `\ɐ\` central, near open vowel

Vowels in the IPA are mapped according to the position of the tongue. The positions of the tongue relative to the bottom or top of the mouth are
described using the terms Open, Near-open, Open-mid, Mid, Close-mid, Near-close, and Close. Open vowels are pronounced with the tongue lowered;
while Lowered vowels are pronounced with the tongue raised.

The position of the tongue relatives to the front or back of the mouth is described using the terms: Front, Central, Back. Front means the front of the
mouth and Back the back.

The `\ɐ\` vowel sound is pronounced with the tongue Near-open (nearly lowered to the bottom of the mouth) and Centrally placed (between front and back).

## German ch Sound

There are two basic **ch** sounds in German the **ch** heard in **ich** or **München** and the **ch** heard in **Ach**. See the IPA for
[München](https://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/München). The more guttaral "ch" sound is used when the "ch" follows the vowels `a`, `o` or `u`,
as in words like:

- auch
- Buch
- besucht
- acht
- achtzig
- hoch
- Hochzeit
- Loch

## German Dark Vowels: a, o and u

The vowels a, o and u are "dark" vowels. They are pronounced deeper in the throat. When they precede "ch", the "ch" has the guttaral sound.
